            privacy controls in your Third-Party Account.</p>
        <h4>Technical Information and Log Files</h4>
        <p>We collect information from your browser, computer, or mobile device, which provide
            us with technical information when you access or use the Services. This technical information includes
            device and network information, cookies, log files and analytics information. Learn more about how we use

        </p>
        <h3>How Cucumber Sports Uses Information</h3>
        <p>Cucumber Sports&nbsp;uses the information we collect and
            receive to operate the Services and to customize them for you. For example, with your consent we use your
            heart rate information to provide you with interesting and useful performance analysis. Subject to your
            <a href="https://cucumbersports.com">privacy
                controls</a>, your information, including parts of your profile, username,
            photos, members you follow and who follow you, clubs you belong to, your activities, the devices you use,
            and kudos and comments you give and receive will be shared on Cucumber Sports so that you may be able to
            participate in the Services, for example to show your place on a leaderboard. Certain <a
                href="https://cucumbersports.com">information</a>&nbsp;(e.g., your name, and some profile information)
            is also
            available to non-members on the
            web. Your precise location information, such as a route or segment, may also be shared on Cucumber Sports or
            to non-members, in accordance with your privacy controls.</p>
        <p>We use the information we collect about you, your followers, and your activities to
            customize your experience. For example, we may suggest segments, routes, challenges, or clubs that may
            interest you, or athletes that you may want to follow. We also use the information we collect to process
            payments, provide support related to the Services, protect members and enforce our <a
                href="https://cucumbersports.com">Terms
                of Service</a>, promote safety, and to communicate with you (including to send
            marketing and push communications) where you have not opted out of receiving such messages and
            notifications.</p>
        <p>We also use the information we collect to analyze, develop and improve the Services.
            To do this, Cucumber Sports may use third-party analytics providers to gain insights into how our Services
            are used and to help us improve the Services.</p>
        <p>We may also use the information we collect to market and promote the Services,
            activities on Cucumber Sports, and other commercial products or services. This includes customizing your
            Cucumber Sports experience. For example, if we know that you like to run, we may tell you about new running
            events or show you sponsored content related to running. If we see that you run in a certain area, we may
            suggest a race in that area. Subject to your settings, we may also mention that you have used our
            partners&rsquo; products or services as part of your activities, which we refer to as <a
                href="https://cucumbersports.com">Sponsored
                Integrations</a>.</p>
        <h4>Aggregate Information</h4>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. Cucumber Sports may
            aggregate the information you and others make available in connection with the Services and post it publicly
            or share it with third parties. Examples of the type of information we may aggregate include information
            about equipment, usage, demographics, routes and performance. Cucumber Sports may use, sell, license, and
            share&nbsp;this aggregated information&nbsp;with third parties for research, business or
            other purposes.</p>
        <h3>How Information is Shared</h3>
        <p>In addition to sharing aggregated data about our members as described above, we also
            share personal information in accordance with your preferences, as needed to run our business and provide
            the Services, and where required for legal purposes, as set forth below.</p>
        <h4>Service Providers</h4>
        <p>We may share your information with third parties who provide services to Cucumber
            Sports such as supporting, improving, promoting and securing the Services, processing payments, or
            fulfilling orders. These service providers only have access to the information necessary to perform these
            limited functions on our behalf and are required to protect and secure your information. We may also engage
            service providers to collect information about your use of the Services over time on our behalf so that we
            or they may promote Cucumber Sports or display information that may be relevant to your interests on the
            Services or other websites or services.</p>
        <h4>Third Party Business via API or Other Integrations</h4>
        <p>We enable you to share your information and content with third party apps, plugins,
            or websites that integrate with the Services, as well as with third parties who work with Cucumber Sports to
            offer an integrated feature, such as a challenge sponsor or tracking watch. You can choose to share your
            profile data and activity data (including private activities). If you click on the link for a sponsored
            integration, you will leave our platform and the sponsor may be able to identify that you visited their
            platform from Cucumber Sports. Information collected by these third parties is subject to their terms and
            policies. Cucumber Sports is not responsible for the terms or policies of third parties.</p>
        <h4>Affiliates and Acquirors of our Business or Assets</h4>
        <p>We may share your information with affiliates under common control with us, who are
            required to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with regard to your information. If Cucumber Sports
            becomes involved in a business combination, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution or
            other similar transaction, we may share or transfer your information in connection with such
            transaction.</p>
        <h4>Legal Requirements</h4>
        <p>We may preserve and share your information with third parties, including law
            enforcement, public or governmental agencies, or private litigants, within or outside your country of
            residence, if we determine that such disclosure is allowed by the law or reasonably necessary to comply with
            the law, including to respond to court orders, warrants, subpoenas, or other legal or regulatory process. We
            may also retain, preserve or disclose your information if we determine that this is reasonably necessary or
            appropriate to prevent any person from death or serious bodily injury, to address issues of national
            security or other issues of public importance, to prevent or detect violations of our <a
                href="https://cucumbersports.com">Terms
                of Service</a>&nbsp;or fraud or abuse of Cucumber Sports or its members, or to
            protect our operations or our property or other legal rights, including by disclosure to our legal counsel
            and other consultants and third parties in connection with actual or potential litigation.</p>
        <h4>DMCA Notices</h4>
        <p>We may share your information with third parties when we forward <a href="https://cucumbersports.com">Digital
                Millennium Copyright Act</a>&nbsp;(DMCA) notifications, which will be forwarded
            as submitted to us without any deletions.</p>
        <h3>How We Protect Information</h3>
        <p>We take several measures to safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of the
            data we collect. We employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its
            sensitivity. The Services use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the
            encryption of personal information and credit card numbers. Cucumber Sports engages providers that are
            industry leaders in online security, including Services verification, to strengthen the security of our
            Services. The Services are registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm
            Cucumber Sports&rsquo;s identity before any personal information is sent. In addition, Cucumber
            Sports&rsquo;s secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology.</p>
